    readme.txt - this file
    
    status.txt - describes the latest status of the 1981-2010 Normals
		 
    Below are descriptions of the five directories at this level. Note that 
    directories A-D describe the most popular elements of the 1981-2010 Normals
    products. This includes daily/monthly/seasonal/annual normals of temperature,
    precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth; various additional parameters based on
    these variables such as heating and cooling degree days, threshold exceedances,
    and others; and hourly normals of a number of different variables. Additional
    normals products are found in E - the supplemental directory - which contains its
    own readme and status files. See E below for additional details.    

    A. products directory

       The 1981-2010 Normals are located in the products directory. Within 
       products, there are four subdirectories:       
         
       1. hourly - contains all normals derived from hourly data, including
          temperature, dew point temperature, heat index, wind chill, wind, 
          cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, and pressure normals.
       2. precipitation - contains all precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth 
          normals files including percentiles, frequencies, and averages.
       3. temperature - contains all temperature-related normals files, including 
          maximum and minimum temperature normals, heating and cooling degree 
          day normals, and others.
       4. auxiliary - contains free-formatted files in two subdirectories:
       	  a. station - contains all daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual normals
             found in the below temperature and precipitation directories, but
             organized as one file per station. Users wanting to visually inspect 
	     normals for just one or a few stations should use the files in this 
	     subdirectory.
	  b. high-precision-degree-days - contains daily heating and cooling 
	     degree days at various bases. Values are reported to the hundredths
	     place as opposed to whole degrees. These files are intended for users
	     that need extra precision for ensuring consistency between daily
	     heating and cooling degree day normals and their associated monthly,
	     seasonal, and annual totals.

    B. station-inventories directory

       This directory contains station inventories for each product class. These
       inventories include the GHCN-Daily ID, latitude, longitude, state, and 
       station names. The temperature and precipitation inventories also specify 
       whether the station is a pseudonormal station. 

       1. allstations.txt contains all stations in the most recent Normals release
       2. hly-inventory.txt contains all stations used in the hourly analysis
       3. prcp-inventory.txt contains all stations used in the precipitation analysis
       4. snow-inventory.txt contains all stations used in the snowfall analysis
       5. snwd-inventory.txt contains all stations used in the snow depth analysis
       6. temp-inventory.txt contains all stations used in the temperature analysis

       the supplemental directory. Supplemental normals include agriculture-related
       normals such as frost-freeze dates; air freezing index return periods; and 
       10-year (2001-2010) hourly normals. A variety of monthly temperature normals
       computed using something other than a strict 30-year average; including 5-, 
       10-, 15-, and 20-year averages, OCN, and Hinge Fit; will be released in the
       future.

       ID         is the station identification code.  Note that the first two
                  characters denote the FIPS country code, the third character 
                  is a network code that identifies the station numbering system 
                  used, and the remaining eight characters contain the actual 
                  station ID.
       LATITUDE   is latitude of the station (in decimal degrees).
       LONGITUDE  is the longitude of the station (in decimal degrees).
       ELEVATION  is the elevation of the station (in meters, missing = -999.9).

       NAME       is the name of the station.
       GSNFLAG    is a flag that indicates whether the station is part of the GCOS
                  Surface Network (GSN). The flag is assigned by cross-referencing 
                  the number in the WMOID field with the official list of GSN 
                  stations. There are two possible values:

                  Blank = non-GSN station or WMO Station number not available
                  GSN   = GSN station 

       HCNFLAG    is a flag that indicates whether the station is part of the U.S.
                  Historical Climatology Network (HCN).  There are two possible 
		  values:

                  Blank = non-HCN station
                  HCN   = HCN station

       WMOID      is the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) number for the
                  station. If the station has no WMO number, then the field is blank.
       METHOD*    is an indication of whether a "traditional" or a "pseudonormals"
                  approach was utilized for temperature or precipitation. This field
		  in only found in prcp-inventory.txt and temp-inventory.txt

IV. UNITS

    index, wind chill, and air temperature normals and standard deviations. 
    e.g., "703" is 70.3F

    such as days above 90F. e.g., "256" is 25.6 days.

    whole degrees Fahrenheit for heating and cooling degree days (except high
    precision files while are in hundredths of degrees Fahrenheit).

    hundredths of inches for average monthly/seasonal/annual precipitation,

V. SPECIAL VALUES

    -9999: missing or insufficient data; values cannot be computed
    -8888: date not defined (e.g. February 30, September 31) - used in daily files to
           achieve fixed-length records 
    -7777: a non-zero value that would round to zero, for variables bound by zero.
    -6666: parameter undefined; used in precipitation/snowfall/snow depth percentiles 
           when number of nonzero values is insufficient
    -5555: parameter not available because it was inconsistent with another parameter          

VI. FLAGS

    Flags accompany every Normals value and indicate the completeness of the data 
    record used to compute each value, accounting for methodological differences for
    different product classes. There are six flag options described generally below.
    Due to methodological differences, the flags are applied somewhat differently
    between the temperature-based normals and the precipitation-based and hourly 
    normals. For the precipitation-based and hourly normals, the following flags were
    assigned independently for each normals value reported based on number of years
    available for that individual calculation. For temperature-based normals, strong 
    precedence is given to the monthly normals of maximum and minimum temperature, 
    and all other temperature-related normals at the daily, monthly, seasonal, and 
    annual timescales are equivalent to or derived from the flags for these two 
    variables. 
 	
    C = complete (all 30 years used)
    S = standard (no more than 5 years missing and no more than 3 consecutive 
        years missing among the sufficiently complete years)
    R = representative (observed record utilized incomplete, but value was scaled
        or based on filled values to be representative of the full period of record)
    P = provisional (at least 10 years used, but not sufficiently complete to be 
        labeled as standard or representative). Also used for parameter values on 
        February 29 as well as for interpolated daily precipitation, snowfall, and
        snow depth percentiles. 
    Q = quasi-normal (at least 2 years per month, but not sufficiently complete to 
        be labeled as provisional or any other higher flag code. The associated
        value was computed using a pseudonormals approach or derived from monthly
        pseudonormals.
    Blank = the data value is reported as a special value such as -9999
   
    Notes: Flags Q and R are not applicable for hourly normals. Flags Q and R also
    aren't applicable to average number of days with different precipitation, 
    snowfall, and snow depth threshold exceedance; precipitation/snowfall/snow 
    depth probabilities of occurrence; and daily precipitation/snowfall/snow depth 
    percentiles. Further, Q flags are not applicable for standard deviations. High-
    precision degree day values are presented without corresponding flags.
